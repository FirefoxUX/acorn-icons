## Overview
Acorn is Firefox's design system. This repo contains icons used throughout Firefox on desktop and mobile.

## Downloading
Acorn Icons are distributed as semantically versioned releases through a [GitHub release](https://github.com/FirefoxUX/acorn-icons/releases/latest).

To keep up to date with icon updates from the design system, we suggest watching this repository's releases via [custom watch notifications settings](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository).

## Browsing
You'll find both desktop and mobile icon collections inside the `icons` directory under `desktop` and `mobile` directories respectively.

- `icons/desktop` **(Desktop icons will be released in a future version)**
- `icons/mobile` 

Inside each platform's directory, icons will be divided up by directories labeled by size. Inside each size directory, icons will be further divided by file format.

Note that Firefox for desktop and mobile make use of different icon file formats. We distribute our full icon collection in SVG, but also provide iOS icons in PDF, and Android icons in XML. 

Also note that due to different conventions between desktop and mobile, not all icons come in all sizing and format options. Learn more specific technical documentation on desktop, iOS, and Android in our [wiki](https://github.com/FirefoxUX/acorn-icons/wiki/Welcome).

### PDF

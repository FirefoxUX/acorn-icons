## Overview
Acorn is Firefox's design system. This repo contains icons used throughout Firefox on desktop and mobile.

## Downloading
Acorn Icons are distributed as semantically versioned releases through a [GitHub release](https://github.com/FirefoxUX/acorn-icons/releases/latest).

To keep up to date with icon updates from the design system, we suggest watching this repository's releases via [custom watch notifications settings](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository).

## Browsing
You'll find both desktop and mobile icon collections under `desktop` and `mobile` directories respectively within the `icons` directory. Icons will be divided up by directories labeled by size.

## Sizing
Acorn Icons come in a few different sizes based on the context they are used within Firefox. Note that for that reason not all icons come in all sizing options. Here are our different sizes:

- XSmall: 8x8
- Small: 16x16
- Medium: 20x20
- Large: 24x24

The default size for mobile icons is 24x24. The default size for desktop icons is 16x16.

## Formats
Firefox for desktop and mobile make use of different icon file formats. We distribute our full icon collection in SVG, but also provide iOS icons in PDF, and Android icons in XML. Note that currently Android is the only platform that has a solo 8x8 icon, and for that reason you won't find it in PDF format.
